# Python GUI Programming Using Tkinter

This is the repository for my code following the course [Python GUI Programming with Tkinter | #30daychallenge](https://www.udemy.com/python-gui-programming-with-tkinter-30daychallenge/) on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com). In this course, I am developing a Python-based music player with a graphical user interface (GUI) using [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). 


#### Issues
A few issues that I am running into with this course is that the author is using a Windows computer and I am running a MacOS. The iconbitmap command, as used on Windows, is not working on MacOS and I haven't found a fix for it yet. Also, the icons used are downloaded in png format but the MacOS version of Tkinter does not recognize the format so it has been converted to gif.

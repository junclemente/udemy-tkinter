# Python GUI Programming Using Tkinter

This repository contains the desktop applications I am developing using Tkinter and Python3. There are five fully functioning desktop apps that I will be creating following the course listed below. 

Since this repository is for learning about Tkinter, the application may not have been tested for errors and/or edge cases. This may be corrected in the future to develop a more robust program, but as of right now, assume that the program may break if the instructions aren't followed.

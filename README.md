### Simple Food Price Calculator

_Description_: This app calculates the cost of the food selected using a radio button. 

_How To Use_: 

1. Download the ```food_price.py``` file and run the app by typing ```python3 food_price.py``` or whatever method you use to run a Python3 file. 
2. Select a food item by clicking the adjacent radio button. 
3. Type an integer into the box next to "Cal".
4. Click the "Cal" button.
5. Magic! The box labeled "Price" will show the value of the 'cost' of the food item multiplied by the number entered in "Cal".
